# 🔊 System Programming Project  

## 📖 Description  
This project is a **system-level application** written in **C++** that implements a **multithreaded text-to-speech (TTS) system**. It converts input text into speech by leveraging **concurrent processing** with multiple threads, improving efficiency and responsiveness with each version.  

---

## 📌 Features  
✔️ **Efficient text-to-speech conversion**  
✔️ **Multithreading with dynamic thread allocation**  
✔️ **Thread pool management** for optimized concurrency  
✔️ **Work-stealing algorithm** for load balancing  
✔️ **Logging system** for debugging and analysis

## 🎯 Why This Project?  
🔹 Text-to-speech (TTS) systems play a crucial role in:  
   - **Accessibility** features for visually impaired users  
   - **Language learning** tools  
   - **Navigation systems**  
   - **AI-powered voice assistants**  

By integrating **multithreading**, this project **efficiently processes large volumes of text**, improving performance with each iteration. The goal is to **continuously optimize speed and responsiveness** over multiple versions.
